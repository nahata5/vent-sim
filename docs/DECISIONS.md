# Decisions

Deviations from the design spec and choices the spec leaves open, with reasoning. Newest last.

## D-001 · UI framework: Preact with TSX (2026-09-10)

The spec allows "vanilla TS or Preact". The settings panel, monitor, dashboard, cards, quiz and instructor
editor are a lot of stateful DOM. Preact (about 4 kB) keeps that manageable without a heavy framework.
Waveforms and loops stay on custom Canvas2D as required. No JSX plugin is needed: esbuild's automatic JSX
runtime with `jsxImportSource: preact` is configured in `vite.config.ts` and `tsconfig.json`.

## D-002 · Ventilator logic runs at the device rate, physics at 1 kHz (2026-09-10)

Spec §2.2 says the ventilator sees only device-rate measured signals. The controller therefore evaluates
trigger and cycle rules every `1/fs` s (default 100 Hz) on the sensor-chain output and holds its command
between evaluations. The flow source, pressure servo and exhalation valve are continuous physics at 1 kHz.
This reproduces the detection-latency component of trigger delay for free.

## D-003 · Lung recoil anchored to phenotype Ppl0; FRC is a phenotype parameter (2026-09-10)

Spec §4.2 says FRC should be solved at initialization. Brief 2 §3 keeps FRC as a parameter (needed for
strain), and Table 1 gives end-expiratory Pes per phenotype. We keep FRC as the phenotype's relaxation
volume, define compartment volume `V_i` relative to its share of FRC, and anchor the lung recoil so that
`PL_i(0) = −Ppl0_i` (static equilibrium at zero PEEP with no effort). What is solved at initialization is
the static equilibrium at the *set PEEP*, so the change in EELV with PEEP, Ppl at PEEP and PL at PEEP all
emerge from the model. The Venegas curve supplies the nonlinear shape around that anchor.
